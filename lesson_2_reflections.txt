*What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, you make it possible to keep track of changes
that occur within the files of the given respository.


*How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area holds files that are ready to be committed.
I'm not entirely sure what value comes from the staging area.
